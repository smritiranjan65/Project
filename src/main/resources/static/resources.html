            <h2>Types of Cyber Threats</h2>
            <p>Cyber threats are malicious attempts to damage or disrupt systems and networks. Here are some common types:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Malware</strong>: Malicious software designed to harm or exploit any programmable device, service, or network. This includes viruses, worms, trojans, ransomware, and spyware.</li>
                <li><strong>Phishing</strong>: A technique where attackers send fraudulent communications, typically emails, that appear to come from a reputable source to steal sensitive data like login credentials or financial information.</li>
                <li><strong>Ransomware</strong>: A type of malware that encrypts the victim's files and demands a ransom payment to restore access to the data.</li>
                <li><strong>Denial of Service (DoS)</strong>: An attack that aims to shut down a network or service by overwhelming it with traffic, rendering it inaccessible to legitimate users.</li>
                <li><strong>Man-in-the-Middle (MitM)</strong>: An attack where the attacker secretly intercepts and potentially alters the communication between two parties without their knowledge.</li>
                <li><strong>SQL Injection</strong>: A code injection technique that exploits a vulnerability in an application's software by inserting malicious SQL statements into an input field, allowing attackers to interact with the database.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Types of Cyber Frauds</h2>
            <p>Cyber fraud involves deceptive practices that exploit the internet to deceive individuals or organizations for financial gain. Here are common types:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Online Scams</strong>: Deceptive schemes conducted over the internet to trick individuals into giving away money or personal information. Examples include lottery scams, fake charities, and get-rich-quick schemes.</li>
                <li><strong>Identity Theft</strong>: The fraudulent acquisition and use of someone else's personal information, typically for financial gain. This can occur through phishing, hacking, or stolen documents.</li>
                <li><strong>Credit Card Fraud</strong>: Unauthorized use of someone's credit card information to make purchases or withdraw funds. This can happen through phishing, card skimming, or data breaches.</li>
                <li><strong>Investment Fraud</strong>: Scams involving fraudulent investment opportunities that promise high returns with little risk. Examples include Ponzi schemes and fake investment platforms.</li>
                <li><strong>Business Email Compromise (BEC)</strong>: A type of cyber fraud targeting businesses where attackers use email to impersonate executives or employees and trick others into transferring money or sensitive information.</li>
                <li><strong>Social Engineering</strong>: Manipulative tactics used to deceive individuals into divulging confidential information or performing actions that lead to security breaches. This can include pretexting, baiting, and tailgating.</li>
